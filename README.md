# 21 Savage Fan Site With User Authentication

Welcome to the updated version of the Savage Demo application â€“ a 21 Savage message board site for fans! This iteration introduces user authentication, allowing users to log in and sign up for the site. Users are identified in the message board through their account email, and they have the ability to delete their account using the unlink button and log out as well.
